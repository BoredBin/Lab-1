        <p align="left"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week." target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've never been. Luckily, I'm
          here to give you an insider's guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips
          and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>

          <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

          <p></p>

            <p align="left">If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected
              my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and
              make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the
              whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you
              want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

        <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
        <center><img src="/2.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; "></center>
        <p align="left">Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will
          show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
          express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day.
          Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
